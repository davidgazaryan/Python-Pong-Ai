# Python-Pong-Ai




## About The Project       🏓


PongAI is an app I made with the pygame library and NEAT algorithm. NEAT is "an evolutionary algorithm that creates artificial neural networks."
Since the algorithm is evolutionary, it passes through a certain number of generations, which can be configured in the configurations.txt file among other things.
As reproduction and mutation continues through generations, the AI slowly starts to play more and more perfectly racking up hits which is displayed in the middle in red.

The goal is to ultimately evolve and have the AI play perfectly once all the generations have finished.
